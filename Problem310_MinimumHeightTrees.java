 * For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.
 *
 * Format
 * The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).
 *
 * You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
 *
 * Example 1 :
 *
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
 *
 *         0
 *         |
 *         1
 *        / \
 *       2   3
 *
 * Output: [1]
 * Example 2 :
 *
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]
 *
 *      0  1  2
 *       \ | /
 *         3
 *         |
 *         4
 *         |
 *         5
 *
 * Output: [3, 4]
 * Note:
 *
 * According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
 * The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
 *
 * 思路：
 * 类似拓扑排序的方法，首先建立节点-度数表，度数为1的是叶子节点，
 * 把叶子节点从表中删掉，同时删除过程中新产生的叶子节点加入节点-度数biao
